# Klicky probe dock for Pandora - Screw option and better mounting support

A modified version of the Pandora Klicky probe mount / arm that supports a Black Oxide M3x8 SHCS screw in addition to the normal magnet.  This allows for variable strength of the magnet holding the probe in the dock.  In addition, the stabilizers around the mounting holes of the arms have been extended to the sides of the arm for better mounting stability.
